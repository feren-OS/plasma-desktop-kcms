"<h1>Service Manager</h1><p>This module allows you to have an overview of all "
"plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, "
"there are two types of service:</p><ul><li>Services invoked at startup</"
"li><li>Services called on demand</li></ul><p>The latter are only listed for "
"convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In "
"Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at "
"startup.</p><p><b> Use this with care: some services are vital for Plasma; "
"do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.</b></p>"
